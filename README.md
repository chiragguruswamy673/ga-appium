# GA + Appium Automation Project

This repository demonstrates a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** integrated with **Appium** for automated mobile testing.  
It evolves test cases to maximize fitness scores, validating app flows and accessibility across Android environments.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Genetic Algorithm core** (`ga/`): evolves test sequences based on fitness scoring.
- **Appium helpers** (`appium_helpers/`): manages driver sessions, locators, and UI interactions.
- **Utility scripts** (`utils/`, `Scripts/`): environment checks, replay helpers, and CI integration.
- **Reports & Dashboards** (`reports/latest_run/`, `dashboard/`): HTML outputs showing run results and fitness graphs.
- **Environment validation** (`check_env.py`): ensures dependencies and emulator setup are correct.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Mobile Automation:** Appium (Android focus)
- **Testing Frameworks:** PyTest / custom GA runner
- **Genetic Algorithm:** Custom implementation (selection, crossover, mutation)
- **Build & Dependency Management:** Gradle (for APK builds), Maven (if Java helpers), `requirements.txt` for Python
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (workflow automation, emulator setup)
- **Reports/Dashboards:** HTML output generated from GA runs
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / PyCharm (JetBrains family)

## 🧪 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Validate environment:
  python check_env.py


3. Run GA tests:
  python main.py


4. View results:
- Open reports/latest_run/index.html in a browser.
- Fitness graph and dashboard visualizations are embedded there.

## 📊 Fitness Graph

Here’s a sample fitness graph generated by the GA run:

The fitness graph is generated during GA runs and saved in the HTML reports.
To view it:
- Navigate to reports/latest_run/.
- Open the HTML file (index.html or similar) in your browser.
- The graph shows fitness score progression across generations.
